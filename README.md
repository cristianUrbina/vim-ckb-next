# vim-ckb-next

A fun pluggin to make your rgb match current vim mode

## Overview

vim-ckb-next is a pluggin that allows you to link your rgb with vim mode. It is
heavly inspired on [vim-ckb](https://github.com/k80w/vim-ckb), the main
difference is this pluggin uses ckb-next GUI profiles and modes instead of
setting rgb colors directly from the script using `/dev/input/ckb*/cmd`.

## Acknowledgments

[Katie Wolfe]( https://github.com/k80w ) for creating [vim-ckb](https://github.com/k80w/vim-ckb),
becuase is the pluggin I have been using for a while and also I have to admit
that the idea for this script came from it.
